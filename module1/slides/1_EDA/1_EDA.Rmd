# How to prepare the data?

Suppose we are interested in phenotyping Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), a disease that develops when the major blood vessels that supply heart become damaged or diseased.

### Filtering/Screening 

- From a random sample of patients in the EHR warehouse (eg. 4.6 million patients in Partner's EHR database) 

- Filter patients who are likely to have the CAD

# Possible filters 

.pull-left[

### Structured data

- Processed by SQL

- Filter: $\geq 1$ ICD-9 codes for CAD (410.x, 411.x, 412.x, 414.x, 413.x)

### Unstructured data

- Processed by natural language processing (NLP) software

- Filter: $\geq 1$ NLP mentions for any CAD related concepts (CAD, CAD procedures, CAD biomarkers, positive stress test)

# PheCAP data

## A public released dataset from an R package

---

# PheCAP data

Contains data prepared for phenotyping Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).

# Load data

```{r}
library(PheCAP)
library(tidyverse)

# Load data.
data(ehr_data)
data <- PhecapData(ehr_data, "healthcare_utilization", "label", 0.4, patient_id = "patient_id")
data
```

--
### Data overview

- 10,000 patients and 587 features.
- Label is subjective to missing. 
- Split into training and validation set. 

---

# Examine data 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ehr_data %>% head() 
```

--

![](img/ehrdata.png)
--

### Variable explanation

- Labels: "label", whether the patient has the disease, **extracted by clinicians' chart review**

--

- Features: "main_ICD", "main_NLP" refers to total number of billing codes or NLP mentions of the disease

--

- Features: "healthcare_utilization" refers to total number of notes the patient has

--

- Features: “CODx” (n = 10), “NLPx” (n = 574) refers to the counts of a specific code or NLP term, extracted by SQL or NLP

---

# Data structure for phenotyping

.pull-left[

### Labels $Y$

* Available for $n$ patients, $n = 181$
  
### Features $\mathbf{X}$

* Available for $N$ patients, $N = 10000$
* Each patient has $p$ features, $p = 587$

<br>

.pull-left[

### Porblem 1: Extreme missingness on $Y$

- $n \ll N$ so that $n/N \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$

### Problem 2: High-dimensional features

- When $n \ll p$, supervised models can suffer from overfitting

]

---

# Can we leverage information from features?

### Findings

- Feature "main_ICD" = the total number of the disease-related billing codes. 

--

- The more the diesase-related codes, the more **likely** the patient has the disease.

--

- The assumption should remain the same for feature "main_NLP"

--

<br>
<br>

### Let's plot the density of "main_ICD" stratified by patients having the disease or not!

# Density of ICD main

.pull-left[
```{r}
ehr_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(label)) %>%
  mutate(disease = factor(label)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = main_ICD)) +
  geom_density(aes(color = disease))
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
ehr_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(label)) %>%
  mutate(disease = factor(label)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log(main_ICD+1))) +
  geom_density(aes(color = disease))
```
]

--

### The more main_ICD the patient has, the more likely s/he has the disease!

# Other potential indicators

# Challenges of the data 

1. Extreme missingness on $Y$: $n \ll N$ so that $n/N \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$

2. High-dimensional features: when $n \ll p$, supervised models can suffer from overfitting

<br>
<br>

--

# Opportunities of using surrogate features

1. Feature selection to reduce $p$

2. Algorithm development with limited $Y$

3. Algorithm validation with limited $Y$

<br>
<br>

--

### Opportunity 2 and 3 will be covered in the next module!

# Feature selection
<br>
<br>


### 1. Rank correlation (Yu et al. 2015)
### 2. Tail method (Yu et al. 2017)
### 3. Clustering method (Gronsbell et al. 2019)

---

# Prepare data for feature selection

### Data spliting 

- Split the data into train and test set. 
- Fit the model on training set. 
- Validate the model on test set. 

--

```{r}
train_data <- ehr_data %>% filter(patient_id %in% data$training_set)
train_x <- train_data %>% select(starts_with("COD") | starts_with("NLP"))
train_y <- train_data %>% select(label) %>% pull()
```

```{r}
test_data <- ehr_data %>% filter(patient_id %in% data$validation_set) 
test_y <- test_data %>% select(label) %>% pull()
```

--

### Data transformation

- As the features are count data, eg. number of billing codes, it is better to perform transformation to make the distribution **less skewed**. 

```{r}
train_x <- log(train_x + 1)
```

---

# 1. Rank correlation 

#### Motivation: 

- Select features that are highly related to surrogates. 

--

#### Method: 

- Select feature $\mathbf{X}_j$ if the absolute rank correlation between $(S, \mathbf{X}_j)$ > threshold, $j = 1, \dots, p$ 
- where $S$ is $S_{NLP}$ and $\mathbf{X}_j$ is the count of medical term $j$ mentioned.

--

#### Implementation:

```{r}
rankCor <- function (s, x, threshold = 0.15) {
  
  # s: N x 1 surrogates
  # x: N x p features
  # threshold: an constant for significant correlation 
  
  rank_cor <- abs(cor(s, x,  method = "pearson"))
  ind <- which(rank_cor > threshold)
  return(ind)
}
```

---

# 2. Tail method

#### Motivation (Extreme assumption): 

- Patients with **high** main ICD or NLP mentions generally have the phenotype.
- Patients with **extremely** low counts are unlikely to have the phenotype.

.pull-left[
```{r plot-right, fig.show = 'hide'}
ehr_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(label)) %>%
  mutate(disease = factor(label)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = main_ICD + main_NLP)) +
  geom_density(aes(color = disease)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  annotate("rect", fill = "grey", alpha = 0.7, xmin = 1, xmax = 10, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf) +
  xlim(c(0,15))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = 'plot-right', echo = FALSE}
```
]

#### Method: 

- Convert discrete $S$ into binary $S_*$, eg. if $S \leq 1$, $S_* = 0$, if $S \geq 10$, $S_* = 1$
- Fit LASSO $S_* \sim \mathbf{X}$

---
# 2. Tail method (cont'd)

#### Implementation:

Directly use functions from the PheCAP package. 

```{r}
# surrogates <- list(
#   PhecapSurrogate(
#     variable_names = "main_ICD",
#     lower_cutoff = 1, upper_cutoff = 10),
#   PhecapSurrogate(
#     variable_names = "main_NLP",
#     lower_cutoff = 1, upper_cutoff = 10),
#   PhecapSurrogate(
#     variable_names = c("main_ICD", "main_NLP"),
#     lower_cutoff = 1, upper_cutoff = 10))
# 
# feature_selected <- phecap_run_feature_extraction(data, surrogates)
# feature_selected
```
