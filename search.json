Slides and code can be found for an example phenotyping problem below.\nElectronic health records phenotyping [Slides]\nModule 1 Introduction [Slides] [Rmd]\nModule 2 Supervised learning [Slides] [Rmd]\nModule 3 Semi-supervised learning (PheCAP) [Slides] [Rmd]\nModule 4 Alternative approaches [Slides] [Rmd]\nPheCAP\nWe use real EHR data from PheCAP, an R package that implements high-throughput phenotyping using a common automated pipeline.\nRequired packages\nPlease copy and paste the following code into R Console to check and load the packages. We are using R version \\(\\geq\\) 3.6.0.\n\n\n# Specify the packages from CRAN.\npackages <- c(\n    \"PheCAP\",     \n    \"PheNorm\",  \n    \"MAP\", \n    \"glmnet\",     \n    \"tidyverse\",  \n    \"ggplot2\",  \n    \"data.table\", \n    \"mltools\",  \n    \"pROC\",\n    \"parallel\",\n    \"randomForestSRC\",\n    \"SVMMaj\"\n)\n\n# Load the packages.\n# Missing package(s) will be first installed and loaded.  \npackage.check <- lapply(\n  packages,\n  FUN = function(x) {\n    if (!require(x, character.only = TRUE)) {\n      install.packages(x, dependencies = TRUE)\n      library(x, character.only = TRUE)\n    }\n  }\n)\n\n\n\nImplementation\nTo start with, please git clone the repository to local.\n\ngit clone git@github.com:jlgrons/EHR-Phenotyping-Workshop.git\n\nResources\nPublicly available EHR dataset\nPhysioNet\nNational NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) NLP competitions\n\nNLP software\ncTAKES\nclinspacy\nmedspacy\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis website was made with the distill package, drawn mostly from Silvia Canelón’s Sharing Your Work with xaringan.\n\n\n\n",
