## Electronic Health Records Phenotyping Workshop

This website contains materials for Biostatistics Workshop in [2022 SSC Annual Meeting Online](https://ssc.ca/en/meetings/annual/2022-annual-meeting). In this workshop, we will introduce statistical learning methods designed to expedite the phenotyping process in order to improve the scalability of EHR research.  

### PheCAP

We will use the real EHR data examples from PheCAP package. 

The [PheCAP](https://celehs.github.io/PheCAP/) is an R package that implements high-throughput phenotyping with electronic health record (EHR) using a common automated pipeline.  It contains simulated data and real EHR data examples, with structured data and information extracted from the narrative clinical notes using natural language processing (NLP).
